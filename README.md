# laser-Lib
Copy the script within to create your own (semi-)custom laser! What could possibly go wrong?

For example usage, go to [solar-flare.js](https://github.com/K103908/Exotic-Mod/blob/master/scripts/blocks/solar-flare.js) and [solar-flare.hjson](https://github.com/K103908/Exotic-Mod/blob/master/content/blocks/turrets/solar-flare.hjson) in K103908/Exotic-Mod.

Note: I made the stuff in there before this lib.
